# Restaurant-management-system

### problem statement
It will be an interactive system where model restaurant will take order from its customer and
generate bill. System will also generate daily menu list based on the sales of veg and non-veg
items during last 5 days. Use file to store data.

### NOTE
* This code only works on uniux-like os that support certain character and command `clear` to clear screen.
    * This is because in my code, i have used 'system("clear")' a lot.
* **restart** option changes the day number. So that without closing the programme, you can collect 5-day data.
    * **day** used here is not the actual day, it is virtual not real-time based application

> if you find any error, you can open an issue, I will appretiate that.
